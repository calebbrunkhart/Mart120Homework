The Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Command-line interface (CLI) are both ways of interacting with your computer. There are many differences between the GUI and the CLI. The GUI is visual; the user finds directories and files by using icons in their computer. The CLI is used through a terminal. Commands are given to the computer and they help direct you through your directories and such. Most people are only familiar with the GUI. This is because the GUI is much more user friendly. It is built for the ease of use by the user. Using the CLI requires a lot more knowledge of your computer. You need to know names of files and such without seeing them, whereas it is easy to find and access those things using the GUI.
