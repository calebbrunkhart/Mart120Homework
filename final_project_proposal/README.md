I want to create a platforming game. The point of the game is to get through 3 levels. Each one is harder than the last. There are monsters on each level that kill you if they touch you. 

Related works: Mario bros, Hollow Knight, Side-scrolling games (rather than scrolling, you must get to a door to go to the next level). 

I will need to figure out collisions. Mainly collisions with enemies, but also a collision that sends the player to the next room. I will also need to figure out how to add a player sprite to the game rather than just drawing with lines and shapes. 

Work Plan: 
5/1: Character on screen and finish up level layouts. Start on character movement.

5/2: Finish character movement. get enemies and collisions w/ them finished. 

5/3: Collsion with 'door' that moves player onto the next level.

5/4: UI (loser and winner screen), final testing and final touches.

5/5: turn in finished product. 

I have completed some basic level designs. I am not completely happy with them yet, but they are headed in the right direction.
